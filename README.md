Etch A Sketch Project for the Odin Project.

A grid of squares is created using Javascript. The squares change color when the user passes over them with the mouse while maintaining the mouse button down.

Functionalities:
- Possibility to change the number of cells in the grid using a slider.
- There are 4 different modes:
        . Color mode: The default color is black. The color can be changed using a color picker.
        . Rainbow mode: A different random color is generated for each cell.
        . Shadow: The more you pass on a cell, the darker the color gets, from light grey to black. Once a cell is black, the color does not change anymore until changing the mode or using the Eraser or Clear buttons.
- The Eraser button allows to erase the color of the cell you hover on by simply changing its color to white.
- The Clear button reset the grid to a blank new one. The mode selected is the last one selected before clicking on the Clear Button. Exception: If Eraser was the last mode selected before clicking on the Clear button, the Color mode is selected by default after resetting the grid.

Technologies used:
- HTML
